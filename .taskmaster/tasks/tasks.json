Type Safety & Validation\n- สร้าง src/types/auth.ts พร้อม Zod schemas สำหรับ form validation\n- สร้าง src/types/database.ts พร้อม type-safe Prisma types\n- ครอบคลุม validation สำหรับเบอร์โทรไทย และ password requirements\n\n4. Utility Functions\n- สร้าง src/lib/utils.ts พร้อม helper functions\n- Phone number formatting และ validation\n- Thai date formatting \n- String manipulation utilities\n- Debounce และ performance utilities\n\n5. Modern Form Components\n- สร้าง LoginForm component ด้วย React Hook Form + Zod\n- สร้าง RegisterForm component พร้อม password strength indicator\n- รองรับ client-side validation และ user-friendly error messages\n- รองรับ loading states และ accessibility\n\n6. Enhanced Server Actions\n- ปรับปรุง login/register actions ให้มี proper error handling\n- รองรับ structured response types (AuthResponse)\n- เพิ่ม user profile creation ใน registration flow\n- Better error messages และ validation\n\n7. SEO & Metadata Improvements\n- อัปเดต layout.tsx พร้อม comprehensive metadata\n- รองรับ Open Graph และ Twitter Cards\n- เพิ่ม security headers และ PWA support\n- ตั้งค่า language เป็นภาษาไทย\n\n8. Enhanced Middleware\n- ปรับปรุง route protection logic\n- เพิ่ม error handling และ security headers\n- รองรับ redirect parameters\n- Performance optimization สำหรับ static assets\n\n9. Code Quality & Standards\n- แก้ไข ESLint warnings/errors ทั้งหมด\n- แก้ไข TypeScript type errors ทั้งหมด\n- ใช้ consistent naming conventions\n- เพิ่ม comprehensive error handling\n\n10. Dependencies Updates\n- เพิ่ม lucide-react สำหรับ modern icons\n- เพิ่ม clsx และ tailwind-merge สำหรับ utility classes\n- รองรับ libraries ที่จำเป็นสำหรับ modern development\n\nผลลัพธ์:\n- โค้ดมี type safety 100%\n- ไม่มี linting errors หรือ type errors\n- Architecture ที่ scalable และ maintainable\n- UX/DX ที่ดีขึ้นอย่างมาก\n- พร้อมสำหรับการพัฒนาต่อใน task ถัดไป\n</info added on 2025-06-30T16:25:13.581Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-01T01:16:23.977Z>\n⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE ALERT - Authentication System Refactor Required\n\nการเปลี่ยนแปลงสำคัญที่จะเกิดขึ้นใน Task 13:\n\nMIGRATION จาก Supabase Auth เป็น Manual Authentication:\n- ยกเลิกการใช้ SMS OTP authentication\n- เปลี่ยนเป็น email-based password reset ผ่าน Resend service\n- ใช้ JWT token system (access token: 24 ชั่วโมง, refresh token: 30 วัน)\n- Authentication ด้วย phone number + hashed password\n- เพิ่ม optional email field สำหรับ password reset functionality\n- เพิ่ม password complexity validation requirements\n- แยก Supabase Storage สำหรับ file uploads เท่านั้น (ไม่ใช้ auth)\n- ลบไฟล์และ dependencies ที่เกี่ยวข้องกับ Supabase auth\n\nIMPACT ต่อ Current Implementation:\n- AuthContext จะต้องปรับปรุงให้รองรับ JWT token management\n- Authentication forms จะต้อง refactor ให้รองรับ email field\n- Server actions จะต้องเปลี่ยนจาก Supabase auth เป็น custom JWT handling\n- Session management จะเปลี่ยนจาก Supabase sessions เป็น JWT-based\n- Route protection logic จะต้องปรับให้ทำงานกับ JWT tokens\n\nNOTE: การ refactor นี้จะทำให้ authentication system ที่พัฒนาไว้ต้องมีการปรับปรุงครั้งใหญ่ใน Task 13\n</info added on 2025-07-01T01:16:23.977Z>",
